# Encode2024 üõ°Ô∏è

**Encode2024** is a hackathon project aimed at **tackling the rise of misinformation and fake news**, particularly due to AI-generated content.  
The platform leverages **decentralized technologies**, including blockchain and **zero-knowledge proofs**, to **detect and verify misinformation** in a secure, transparent way.

I contributed as the **frontend developer**, building the user interface in **React** to make the platform intuitive and responsive.
